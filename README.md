- I’m Kim Wood (@tc-hunter), an associate professor in the Department of Hydrology & Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Arizona.
- I’m interested in empowering scientific discovery, innovation, and science communication through interrogation of datasets via Python.
- I’m still learning how to use GitHub, and I upload example scripts in my spare time, so please bear with me as I figure out this system and how to respond to feedback.
- I’m looking to collaborate on atmospheric science and related topics ranging from hazard communication and data visualization to the interactions between a tropical cyclone and its environment.
- How to reach me: https://kouya.has.arizona.edu or via social media (@DrKimWood on BlueSky).
