- 👋 Hi, I’m Dr. Kim Wood (@tc-hunter), an assistant professor in the Department of Geosciences at Mississippi State University.
- 👀 I’m interested in empowering scientific discovery, innovation, and science communication through interrogation of datasets via Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub, and I upload example scripts in my spare time, so please bear with me as I figure out this system and how to respond to feedback.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on atmospheric science topics ranging from hazard communication and data visualization to the interactions between a tropical cyclone and its environment.
- 📫 How to reach me: http://arashi.geosci.msstate.edu or via Twitter (@DrKimWood).
